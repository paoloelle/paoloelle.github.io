I attended the <a href='https://mrs.fel.cvut.cz/summer-school-2024/'>2024 IEEE RAS Summer School on Multi-Robot Systems</a> from 29.07.2024 to 03.08.2024 in the beautiful city of Prague. It was an amazing event where I had the opportunity to meet colleagues from all over the world doing research in multi-robot systems!
