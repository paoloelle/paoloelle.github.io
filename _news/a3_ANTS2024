I had the chance to attend <a href='https://www.uni-konstanz.de/ants-2024/#'>ANTS 2024 - The Fourteenth International Conference on Swarm Intelligence</a> as a volunteer, held at the <a href='https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/collective-behaviour/'>Center for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour</a>. So inspiring to see research where robotics and biology work together.
