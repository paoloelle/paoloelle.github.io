Attending the <a href='https://mrs.fel.cvut.cz/summer-school-2024/'>2024 IEEE RAS Summer School on Multi-Robot Systems</a> from July 29th to August 3rd 2024, in the beautiful city of Prague. I had the opportunity to connect with many colleagues doing research in multi-robot systems.

    transform: scale(1.5); /* Ingrandisce del 20% */
