I'm a PhD Student in the [Cyber-physical Systems group](https://www.cps.uni-konstanz.de) at the [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de), Germany, lead by [Prof. Heiko Hamann](https://heikohamann.de), and member of the [Center for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour](https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/collective-behaviour/). My research interests are swarm robotics and evolutionary robotics; in my project I'm studying the emergence of division of labour in robot swarms.

I hold a Master's Degree in Computer and Robotics Engineering (curriculum Robotics Engineering) from [Università degli Studi di Perugia](https://www.unipg.it), Italy.
